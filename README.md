# Frost's Gen 5 Editor #

This is a general purpose editor made to handle all of the most important rom hacking features in a single user friendly package. It fully supports black 2 and white 2 roms and mostly supports black and white roms with a few features missing.

Currently, the editor contains the following features:
- Pokemon stats, movesets, evolutions, tms, tutors, and egg moves
- Pokemon sprites and icons (experimental)
- Move data
- Move animations (experimental)
- Trainers and trainer teams
- Wild encounters
- Hidden Grottos
- Overworld data, objects, and npcs
- Scripting (experimental)
- Text
- Pokemarts (BW2 only)
- Experience curves
- Custom game modes (some are BW2 only)
- Rom patching (alternative to xdelta, less feature complete but capable of merging patches to an extent)
- File extraction for hex edits

## Common Issues ##

Roms that include the fairy type implementation (This includes Blaze Black 2 and Volt White 2 Redux) will require you to open the text editor, file 199 for BW or 398 for BW2, and add "Fairy" to the list of types before edits can be made.

This editor should be fully compatible with rom hacks and other editors with the exception of White 2 Upgrade.
